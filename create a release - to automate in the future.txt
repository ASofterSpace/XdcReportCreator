1. call build.bat

2. zip up the following:

bin
files
input.json
run_creator.bat
run_creator.sh
run_improver.bat
run_improver.sh
UNLICENSE

3. maybe adjust the documentation living under asofterspace.com/xdc/generate.pdf

(in the future, we might instead want to distribute JARs - they can be created using jar.exe, but require a manifest file to be present and require different approaches for reading files that are kept inside)
